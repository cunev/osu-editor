# Sample P5 Editor

This is a very simple base for complex editors that require Dragging and Zooming in an infinite space.

You can use this to render custom stuff and give users ability to freely move around using Middle mouse hold for drag and CTRL+scroll for zooming.

That's about it.

Stack: P5, Vite, TypeScript.
